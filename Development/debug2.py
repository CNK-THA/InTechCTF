This python code will loop through numbers from 0 upto 10000. It will display the number that is less than
2500 and number that is more than 2483. The numbers must also be divisible by 7 (when modulo by 7 gives a 0)
and divisible by 4 (when modulo by 4 gives a 0).

Fix syntax error in this code and it will display your answer.
