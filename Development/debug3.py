The following python class will perform basic arthimetic operations. 

Fix the code below. Once you have correctly fixed all the error follow these instructions:

1. create a DoMath class object and save it in a variable called iLoveMath
2. call addition function with parameters a = 4 and b = 10, save the result to a variable called value1
3. call subtraction function with parameters a = value1 and b = 3, save the result to a variable called value2
4. call multiplication function with parameters a = value2 and b = 11, save the result to a variable called value3
5. call division function with parameters a = value3 and b = 3, save the result to a variable called value4
6. print the value1,2,3,4 as your final answer

e.g. if your value1 = 34, value2 = 93, value3 = 99, value4 = 12 then yourfinal answer would be
flag{34_93_99_12}
